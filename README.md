MoodKick App
======

The Moodkick App is an app that users use on their smartphones to interact with the MoodKick Server Backend.

_A more in-depth description is to be developed._

The app is written in HTML5, using Angular.JS as the MVC framework and wrapped with PhoneGap to make it run natively on iOS and Android smartphones (and in the future also on other platforms).
